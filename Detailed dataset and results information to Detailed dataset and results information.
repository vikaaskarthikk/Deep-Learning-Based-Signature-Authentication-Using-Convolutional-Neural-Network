Dataset Values
Raw signature images: Store a sample of genuine and forged signatures. 
Image preprocessing info: Resized dimensions (e.g., 224x224), Normalization method (e.g., pixel values scaled to [0,1]), Augmentation applied (rotation, shift, shear, zoom, etc.)

Values Behind Reported Metrics
Save raw values used to calculate means, standard deviations, and accuracy metrics in CSV or JSON format.
Include per-user accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
| UserID | Genuine_Accuracy | Forged_Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1_Score |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 001    | 0.95             | 0.97            | 0.96      | 0.95   | 0.955    |
| 002    | 0.92             | 0.93            | 0.94      | 0.92   | 0.93     |
| ...    | ...              | ...             | ...       | ...    | ...      |

Values Used to Build Graphs
Save accuracy/loss values per epoch during training for reproducibility:
accuracy_per_epoch.csv
loss_per_epoch.csv
| Epoch | Accuracy | Loss |
| ----- | -------- | ---- |
| 1     | 0.85     | 0.45 |
| 2     | 0.88     | 0.38 |
| 3     | 0.91     | 0.32 |
| ...   | ...      | ...  |
These files can be used to recreate your graphs in Matplotlib or Seaborn.

Points Extracted from Images
For CNN models, raw feature points arenâ€™t directly visible, but you can save:
Outputs from intermediate layers (feature maps)
Flattened embeddings from MobileNetV2 before classification head.
